# 🎓 Student Grade Calculator in Java

## 📘 Overview

The **Student Grade Calculator** is a Java-based console application that computes a student’s **total marks**, **average percentage**, and **grade** based on their performance in multiple subjects.
It helps automate the grading process by taking user input for subject marks and applying predefined grading criteria.

This project demonstrates basic **Java programming concepts** such as loops, conditional statements, user input, and modular programming.
